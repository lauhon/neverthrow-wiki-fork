Welcome to the neverthrow wiki!

This wiki contains posts and other information on how to get the most out of `neverthrow`, which, if you're not already familiar with a functional error handling approach (such as in Scala, Elm, Rust, Haskell, and many others) then you might hit a snag or two and uninstall `neverthrow` in frustration.
