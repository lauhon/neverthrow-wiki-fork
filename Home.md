This wiki contains posts and other information on how to get the most out of `neverthrow`, which, if you're not already familiar with a functional error handling approach (such as in Scala, Elm, Rust, Haskell, and many others) then you might hit a snag or two and uninstall `neverthrow` in frustration.

Check out the navigation bar on the side that contains all the articles for the `neverthrow` wiki.
